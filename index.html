    <h2>Quantum Art</h2>
<p>
What is a quantum superposition? Is it some magical connection to a quantum world that is destroyed in everyday life? Or is it just the ambiguity which we know to be integral to all things in life?      
</p>

<p>
This art project is based on the idea that duality as we normaly experience it in every day life is much more interesting and important than the narrow definition of "quantum superposition" used in the physics lab.  Given that, this is an artistic exploration of superposition between images on the Web.  The images can be from anywhere on the web.  Each one has a position, scale, and rotation angle.  A duality is the combination of these two images, with a oscillation that a user interacts with by sliding their finger across a touch screen.  
</p>

<p>
    Quantum Web Dualities can be made in a online factory like the one linked here, but then shared anywhere on the Web.  
</p>
<h2>Organic Media</h2>
<p>
    This work is an experiment in the idea of "organic media".  Organic media shares the most fundamental quality of life that makes it what it is: it self-replicates. That does not just mean you can share a link on social media, as in the case of "viral media".  Rather it means the whole construct, including this entire web page, and the factory to produce more dualities, the information to copy the whole thing, and this documentation <em>all</em> self-replicates.  It self replicates by containing the information required for an interested user to copy the whole thing with minimal effort, just copying a program which copies the rest of the code.  After it's all been copied, it can be edited, and the next time it's copied it will copy the edits, so the system can evolve like a living thing.
